# CSCI160
entry level computer science and python course at TC3.  Coding projects were completed in Python 3 (exact version unknown) in the fall of 2018. I think at the time I was using sublime as an editor.

Most of the scripts here are first-semester easy. functions, arrays, strings, no classes yet. The driver is usually at the bottom of the script.
